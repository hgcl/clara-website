## Life Peek: Christmas via Skype

Christmas is an important event in my family, even though no one is Christian. It has always been a pretext to have a large family gathering with good food—and when I was younger—presents.

This year, we weren't able to meet in person because of the pandemic. Instead, we had a video conference dinner party. In total: four cameras and thirteen people, all eating and talking at the same time. Needless to say, it was a hectic and noisy event.

Yet, I felt at home in the middle of this chaos. Remote or not, the atmosphere was comparable to the one of our usual family reunions: heart-warming, frenetic, sometimes boring, but mostly fun.

      <em>The Murderbot Diaries</em> have a “Deadpool meets The Martian” vibes.
      Created by the Company, Murderbot is a conscious (and self-conscious)
      machine that managed to hack itself to become free. It could have taken
      revenge on humans but chose instead to binge-watch hours of TV series. Who
      said sci-fi had to be serious?

      The IndieWeb is a movement that Robin introduced me to a few months ago.
      The concept is to take control of your content and be able to connect with
      others without using silos—centralized for profit websites. This last
      week, I finally acted on that knowledge and started to create my “IndieWeb
      friendly” website in Next.js. I am pretty excited by this project and will
      tell you more about it in the next issue&ensp;📪
