## Life Peek: Christmas via Skype

Christmas is an important event in my family, even though no one is Christian. It has always been a pretext to have a large family gathering with good food—and when I was younger—presents.

This year, we weren't able to meet in person because of the pandemic. Instead, we had a video conference dinner party. In total: four cameras and thirteen people, all eating and talking at the same time. Needless to say, it was a hectic and noisy event.

Yet, I felt at home in the middle of this chaos. Remote or not, the atmosphere was comparable to the one of our usual family reunions: heart-warming, frenetic, sometimes boring, but mostly fun.

		<cite>The Murderbot Diaries</cite> have a “Deadpool meets The Martian”
		vibes. Created by the Company, Murderbot is a conscious (and self-conscious)
		machine that managed to hack itself to become free. It could have taken
		revenge on humans but chose instead to binge-watch hours of TV series. Who
		said sci-fi had to be serious?

	<p>
		The IndieWeb is a movement that Robin introduced me to a few months ago. The
		concept is to take control of your content and be able to connect with
		others without using silos—centralized for profit websites. This last week,
		I finally acted on that knowledge and started to create my “IndieWeb
		friendly” website in Next.js. I am pretty excited by this project and will
		tell you more about it in the next issue&ensp;📪
