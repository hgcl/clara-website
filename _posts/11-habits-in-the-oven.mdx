## Life Peek: Habit tracking

Instead of proactively working on my new habits this last week, I procrastinated—again—by setting up overkill habit trackers.

I call them overkill because my habit goals are pretty simple:

1. _Easy_: I want to be up by 7am every day.
2. _Medium_: Take at least two 15-minute breaks on work days.
3. _Hard_: Turn off laptop by 7pm every day.

I told you about my [recent obsession](/blog/10-on-obsessions) with building this website. A consequence is that I spend way too much time on my computer. To gather some stats about my screen time, I installed [TimeFibers](https://timefibers.com/) on my laptop and the [StayFree app](https://stayfreeapps.com/) on my phone.

  A digital solution to a digital problem? Yep, I'm not sure it's a good idea
  either.

Every month now, I will try to give a completely transparent habit report to keep me accountable. Most importantly, I will start _actually_ doing some habits this week—pinky swear.

    While browsing books on Open Library, I stumbled upon this graphic novel
    version of <cite>1984</cite> by Fido Nesti. This being a graphic novel, I
    pre-judge it by its cover and don't think twice before adding it to my
    antilibrary.

    In <cite>The Preserve Journal Issue 4</cite>, journalist Kaszmarzyk says{" "}

      I believe everyone goes through the same thing when they receive their
      first copy of <cite>The Art of Fermentation</cite>: you spend days with
      it. You bond and form a relationship like no other with it, because it's
      neither a recipe book nor a nonfiction novel, it is its own special world.

    I have been digitally browsing a lot of cookbooks recently. Chinese cooking
    expert Fuchsia Dunlop warmly recommends <cite>Classic Food of China</cite>{" "}
    by Yan-Kit So. What I like about this book is that it's not only about food
    as it also gives insights about culture and history.

    I have just stumbled upon this gem again as I was sorting through my old
    bookmarks. I immediately added it to the new{" "}
    <Link href="/favorites">✶ page</Link>. It is not a website, nor a book, but
    a treasure chest of practical information about typography.
