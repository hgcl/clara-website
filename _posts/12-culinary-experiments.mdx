## Life Peek: Culinary experiments

I love trying out new recipes—especially the ones that are about creating things that you usually buy. This week, I baked some sourdough croissants. For a first time, it wasn't too bad: not airy, but not dense either, a bit too buttery, but so satisfying. Robin and I had some plain croissants for breakfast, but we also tried a grilled cheese version which was deliciously decadent.

Another recipe I tried this week are those <Link href="/recipe-book/vegetarian-polish-cabbage-rolls">vegetarian Polish cabbage rolls</Link>. It is not easy finding out winter dishes that are seasonal and that make me excited. These rolls did the job perfectly.

  They also exist in Germany as <em>Kohlrouladen</em>, but I stumbled upon the
  vegetarian Polish version first.

    A light rom com that gives just what you are expecting from it. It is
    cheesy, overacted, but very entertaining. (And you just have to love
    Awkwafina.)

    I finally watched this classic that wonderfully depicts the year 2019: dark
    and polluted, people from all nationalities mixing, not one dominant
    language, strong Japanese video game feel. Human-like and life-like androids
    are a thing. People still have retro haircuts and clothes—of course. I loved
    the strong vibrations of the soundtrack. Tonight, we are watching the 2049
    edition.

## Discovered

    Musixmatch is another one of these tools that have been lying around forever
    and that I just discovered recently. It connects with your Spotify account
    and shows you the synced song lyrics. We have already had a few spontaneous
    karaokes and I love it.

  <p>
    I discovered Five Books through{" "}
    <Link href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/fuchsia-dunlop-on-chinese-food/">
      Dunlop's interview
    </Link>{" "}
    about Chinese food books. The concept is amazing: asking experts to
    recommend five books in their subject. The result is a curated list of very
    good books in any fields you can think of.
