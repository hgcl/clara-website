## Life Peek: Holiday at home

This week was a bit special as both Robin and I took time off work without any holiday plans. We spent most of it having outdoor walks, doing pizza-related activities and working on our personal projects. _Yes_, I did spend a disproportionate amount of time working on my website.

<Comment>Like that night I couldn't sleep and coded until 1am.</Comment>

I love adding new features to my website and learning to code. The problem is that this website should be a _side_-side-project at best. The reality is that it takes time away from things I would like to focus on.

Something I stopped doing is my routine of reading essays / working on my digital garden. Lately, I am learning a lot coding-wise but not much outside of that.

In that direction, [The Knitting Club](https://www.mirhamasala.com/the-knitting-club/) that Mirha Masala launched with two of her friends inspired me a lot. Every three weeks, they choose a topic, a skill or an activity. The three friends then share their experiences and discuss their learnings. I love this idea of having a _learning club_ where you grow together and keep each other accountable.

    Beautifully crafted stop-motion by the Laika studio, combining traditional
    stop-motion techniques with CGI. It is funny and poetic with just the right
    amount of darkness. <cite>Kubo and the two strings</cite> is everything but
    just a kid movie.

## T(W)IL

This week I learned a few new things:

### To use an API

The [Movies](/movies) page looks pretty much like the existing [Books](/books) page. The difference? I coded it all by myself and had to learn to use the TMDb API on the way there. I had been trying to do it for weeks, so I am quite happy to have finally managed it!

### To make a sourdough pizza

Robin and I decided that this past week was going to be _Pizza Week_. We tried lots of good pizzas, made some pizza-related powerpoints and also learned to make our own with Andrew Janjigian's [sourdough recipe](https://wordloaf.substack.com/p/sourdough-thin-crust-pizza-dough). The result was delicious but it could definitely be improved—even with our tiny microwave oven.

<Comment>
  Note: Janjigian is one of these “cooking creators” who don't just give you a
  flat recipe—but also the story or science behind it. I just love these new
  cooking channels and blogs that go further than necessary.
