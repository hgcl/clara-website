## Projects

This last month, Robin and I have been working on our first online treasure hunt: [The Missing Banksy](the-missing-banksy.vercel.app/). We are very proud of it, but are still actively trying to improve it.

Next step: create a second chapter!

## Habits

- Breaks and screen time — Since my last paper tracker for breaks and screen time has been filled, I also stopped doing these two habits regularly. To avoid this very dumb obstacle, I have created an easy-to-print tracker.
- Up before 7am — I still follow through with the waking up early habit even though I don't necessarily track it anymore.
- New possession list — I started to write a list of all my belongings. My goal is to be more mindful of what I possess to reduce it to the most important only.
