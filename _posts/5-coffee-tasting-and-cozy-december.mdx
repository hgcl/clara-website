## Life Peek: Cozy December

Last Tuesday, something very special happened: December 1st. Robin and I were waiting for it for a long time as we could finally open our Coffee Advent Calendar from [19grams](https://19grams.coffee/en)—a Berlin-based coffee roastery. I am now excited to start every morning with a meditative coffee tasting session.

Besides that, this week definitely had some end-of-the-year vibes. I have been listening to a lot of chill classics: some jazz, soul and a bit of blues.

It actually feels so much like cozy December that I even started reflecting on the year—here is my [Year in Review 2020](https://www.notion.so/Year-in-Review-2020-f430491c0ec243128863b5fd59dcb295). I like Steve Schlafman's approach of spreading this reflection over two weeks. For once, it doesn't feel like an overwhelming chore.

    Kate Clanchy loves her students and you feel it. In this memoir, she invites
    you to meet some of them on a journey about passion, cultural bridges, pain
    and creativity. A moving and raw account of thirty years of teaching and
    learning. I am now going straight away to her new book
    <cite>How to Grow Your Own Poem</cite>.

    In this long-form article, Dan Wang denounces our fixation on the digital
    and computing industry when talking about technology. He explains the three
    forms technology can take—as tools, instructions or process knowledge. Very
    interesting read on the lure of the digital and what truly drives
    innovation.

    I've just discovered this Berlin-based food vlogger on YouTube and I already
    love his channel. I can't exactly say what I like about it. Maybe it's his
    long historical and contextual intros, the way he travels—that feels so
    close to mine—or maybe just his genuine love for food.

    Was I talking about PaperSpan just last week? Well... Robin convinced me to
    upgrade to the next level of annotating tools: Hypothesis. Built on
    open-source technology and interoperable standards, you can highlight and
    annotate the web completely free of charge. Its development is transparent
    and collaborative through their public roadmap on GitHub.
