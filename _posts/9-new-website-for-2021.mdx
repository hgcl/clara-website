## Life Peek: New website for 2021

<p>
  I had an incredibly productive last week of the year, as I threw together my
  new website from—
  <Link href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter">
    almost
  </Link>
  —scratch. Having a clear and attainable goal really helped me speed learn
  through the basics of React. I realized that I actually do learn best by{" "}
  <em>doing</em>.{" "}

    (I am pretty satisfied with the <Link href="/books">books</Link>,{" "}
    <Link href="/about">about</Link> and <Link href="/now">now</Link> pages.)

With Robin, we spent New Year's eve doing a number of adult things:

1. having a fancy meal (homemade tagliatelle topped with this <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belper_Knolle">this grated cheese</Link>)
2. with wine (brought back from our cycling trip to the Chianti region)
3. discussing our Year in Review (based on <Link href="https://annualreview.life/">Schalfman's template</Link>)
4. going to bed at 11.15pm

## Read & Watched

    We all agree that 2020 was pretty sad in terms of movie releases. Well,
    Pixar just saved the year by releasing <cite>Soul</cite>, an animated movie
    about passion, jazz, purpose and what it means to be alive. I just added it
    to my list of favorite Pixar movies of all time—just next to{" "}

  I also watched the new DC release: <cite>WW84</cite>, but needed to close my
  eyes at times because it was just too cheesy to witness.

## Antilibrary

Everything is closed in Berlin at the moment, except for restaurant takeouts, grocery stores and... bookstores. We decided to cycle to Dussman, a giant bookstore with an amazing English section. It couldn't be avoided, my <Link href="/antilibrary">antilibrary</Link> got quite a few additions.

  <p>
    As usual, I spent way too much time in the fantasy / sci-fi section. With
    its mythological, dreamy setup, <cite>Piranesi</cite> really reminded me of{" "}
    <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline_Miller#Circe">
      <cite>Circe</cite>
    </Link>{" "}
    by Madeline Miller—which I loved. This novel by Susanna Clarke will probably
    not be in the antilibrary very long as I intend to read it <em>very</em>{" "}
    soon.

    I know nothing about the author—Adrian Tchaikovsky, but I know I love smart
    sci-fi and space odysseys that dive into civilization building. I am adding
    it here for next time I will be in this kind of mood.

## Discovered

  <p>
    Okay, this tool is definitely not new on the market. But as I only knew HTML
    and CSS so far, Tailwind CSS was a little revolution. It made the whole
    website building process a lot easier and beginner-friendly for me.
