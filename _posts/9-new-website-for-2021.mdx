## Life Peek: New website for 2021

<p>

	new website from—

	through the basics of React. I realized that I actually do learn best by{" "}
	<em>doing</em>.{" "}

With Robin, we spent New Year's eve doing a number of adult things:

1. having a fancy meal (homemade tagliatelle topped with this <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belper_Knolle">this grated cheese</Link>)
2. with wine (brought back from our cycling trip to the Chianti region)
3. discussing our Year in Review (based on <Link href="https://annualreview.life/">Schalfman's template</Link>)
4. going to bed at 11.15pm

		about passion, jazz, purpose and what it means to be alive. I just added it

	I also watched the new DC release: <cite>WW84</cite>, but needed to close my

## Antilibrary

Everything is closed in Berlin at the moment, except for restaurant takeouts, grocery stores and... bookstores. We decided to cycle to Dussman, a giant bookstore with an amazing English section. It couldn't be avoided, my <Link href="/antilibrary">antilibrary</Link> got quite a few additions.
