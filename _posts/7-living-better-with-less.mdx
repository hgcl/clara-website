## Life Peek: Fostering Conversations

I am not much of an outdoor person—lots of allergies and just _life ya know_. From time to time, I will force myself out of the door for a long walk with Robin. And we invariably talk about thought-provoking topics.

I am not sure yet, but I think the secret lies in having a protected space in time for a passive activity—walking in this case. This passive activity doesn't use a lot of mental space. It allows your mind to wander just enough, which fosters these organic conversations.

Our morning coffee tasting routine is another example. More often than not, it will conclude on an in-depth discussion about something random. I might just bring up this topic on our next walk.

    This article shook me. It was written in 2010 by a guy finding a 9–5 job
    after 9 months backpacking. He talks about how much time and energy your
    regular job uses, resulting in you paying for convenience, rewards, a bit of
    excitement, an escape. In other words: the more we work, the more it pushes
    us to consume. The more we consume, the more we have to work to afford it.

  <p>
    Fascinating article about why we envision the ideal family as two parents
    with 2.5 kids, and how the stable nuclear family isn't viable anymore.
    Spoiler: it is because our economical and cultural situation is very
    different. The author explains how we are now going back to new extended
    family structures with <q>forged families</q> and communities.

  <p>
    <em>Wabi-sabi</em> (侘寂) is a Japanese concept describing the appreciation
    of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It is a short meditative
    read that might help me to let go and be a bit less of a perfectionist.

    Written by an Australian couple, this self-help book sounds like a
    light-hearted (and funny) read about living better with less. High-priority
    on my to-read list.

    I didn't discover this browser extension in the last week, but it is just
    too awesome to not mention it at least once. Context: I do{" "}
    <em>everything</em> in dark mode. So whenever a website not supporting dark
    mode pops up, my eyes hurt. A lot. When enabled, Dark Reader automatically
    switches those websites to dark mode with your preferred settings. Bonus
    points:{" "}

    If you have enough of small-talk leading nowhere, this web-app is made for
    you. With different decks for light conversations vs intimate talks, you
    will stumble upon questions like:{" "}

      About what are you superstitious? Is there anyone you look up to? When is
      the last time I impressed you?
