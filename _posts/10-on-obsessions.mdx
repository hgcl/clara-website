## Life Peek: On obsessions

Since the last week of December, I have been _obsessively_ working on my website. Being pretty new to coding, I am always discovering exciting things to try out in this new playground.

The downside is when the obsession gets out of control. It is not uncommon that I stay up until late in the evening building a non-essential feature.

Feeling excited to work on my website is good. The problem is that it replaces other things that I deem important: thinking, reading, cooking, writing, AFK time.

In the coming week, I will set up a few healthy habit trackers. I have—unsuccessfully—done so countless times in the past. The difference this time is that it will be public to keep me accountable.

Until next week for more info!

    I am pretty picky in terms of series and it is not unusual for me to stop
    one a few episodes in. <cite>Maniac</cite> hooked me from the start. In two
    words, I would describe it as <em>retro futuristic</em>. It was directed by
    Cary Joji Fukunaga and I just love his attention to detail.

    <cite>Straw Dogs</cite> by the English philosopher John Gray challenged
    Norbauer's view on <q>pretty much everything</q>. The book is a critique of
    philosophical humanism.

  <p>
    This website simulates the reading experience of a person with dyslexia. The
    letters <q>seem to jump around</q>. I think that it looks a bit too
    extreme—first and last letters of a long word swapping, but it is an
    important reminder of how different our experiences of the world can be.
