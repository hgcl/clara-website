    This TV series is surprisingly good. It is an excellent rendition of
    different TV eras. It gave more substance to Wanda and Vision's
    characters—that we didn't know much until then.

  <p>
    Overall, amazing world building and great character development throughout
    the series—which is quite impressive as there are <em>many</em> of them. I
    really got attached to the characters and story—I will miss Iroh! At times,
    the cheesiness / cringiness level was almost too much. But I guess that's
    not too surprising as the show mostly targets kids.
