## Instructions

1. Boil **milk**
2. Add 1–1.5 tbsp of **vinegar** per liter of milk
3. Milk should curdle, add vinegar if necessary
4. Drain curdled milk with cloth, add **salt**
5. Keep it pressed 1–2h (optional)

Tip 1: Add **truffle oil** (or your favorite **herbs**) at step number 4 for extra tasty flavors!
