## Ingredients

- Milk
- Whie vinegar

## Instructions

1. Boil milk
2. Add 1–1.5 tbsp of vinegar per liter of milk
3. Milk should curdle, add vinegar if necessary
4. Drain curdled milk with cloth, add salt
5. Keep it pressed 1–2h (optional)

Tip 1: Add truffle oil (or your favorite herbs) at step number 4 for extra tasty flavors!

Tip 2: You don't even have to press the cheese. Keep it loose and you have cottage cheese. Mix it with a bit of its water and you have cream cheese!
