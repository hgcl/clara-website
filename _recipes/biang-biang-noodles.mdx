## Instructions

### Noodles

1. Mix **flour**, **salt** and **water** and knead for 5 minutes. Give the dough a hydration rest of 15–30 minutes under a bowl.
2. Knead it again for 5 minutes and let it relax for 10 more minutes.
3. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle of about 5 mm thick.
4. Brush both sides of the dough with a bit of oil. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
5. Have a pot of boiling water ready–set too high, as well as a big bowl of cold water on the side.
6. Cut out strips of 1–2 cm wide. Stretch them out by pulling and flapping them gently on the counter. Add the noodles to the boiling water.
7. Once the water is boiling, add a cup of cold water to kill the boil. Once the water is boiling again, kill the boil once more and let it boil a final time.
8. Transfer the noodles into the bowl of cold water—this will give them their bounciness. Dry the noodles and add them to the serving bowls.

### Spicy sauce

1. Mix all the sauce ingredients together, except for the oil. Add that mixture to the noodle bowls.
2. Heat up a few tablespoons of vegetable oil. Once it is very hot and almost boiling, pour it over the bowls. Eat immediately.
