## Ingredients

- 115g butter, cut into chunks
- 190g packed light brown sugar
- 500g of mashed banana (~5 medium-large bananas)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract / 1 packet Vanillin Zucker
- 1 tsp salt
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 0.5 tsp ground nutmeg
- 260g flour (type 405)
- ~25g raw sugar (on top)
- Chopped walnuts / Kuvertüre (~50g of each)
- 1 tsp baking soda (Natron)
- 1 tsp baking powder

For a sourdough version, replace baking powder with 100 g sourdough starter.

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 150ºC (umluft). Line a 20cm loaf tin.
2. Melt butter in a large pan. Whisk in brown sugar until smooth, then stir in mashed banana.
3. Whisk in eggs and vanilla. Add salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda / Natron, and baking powder. Whisk until the ingredients are fully dispersed in the batter. Watch out for small pockets of dry ingredients in the mix.
4. Add flour and stir until combined. Scrape batter into prepared loaf tin.
5. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the raw sugar; it will seem like a lot but will bake up beautifully.
6. Bake banana bread for 65 to 75 minutes, or more. Test with a skewer – the top third is often slowest to cook. The bread will get very dark but will not taste burnt.
7. Let cool in pan. This banana bread is good on the first day but exceptional on the second and third.
