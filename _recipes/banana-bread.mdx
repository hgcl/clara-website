## Ingredients

<ul>
  <Ingredient v="115" t="g" i="butter, cut into chunks" />
  <Ingredient v="190" i="brown sugar" />
  <Ingredient v="25" t="g" i="raw sugar (for topping)" />
  <Ingredient v="5" i="medium-large mashed bananas" />
  <Ingredient v="2" i="large eggs" />
  <Ingredient v="1" t="packet" i="vanilla sugar" />
  <Ingredient v="1" t="tsp" i="salt" />
  <Ingredient v="1.5" t="tsp" i="ground cinnamon" />
  <Ingredient v="0.5" t="tsp" i="ground nutmeg" />
  <Ingredient v="260" t="g" i="flour (type 405)" />
  <Ingredient v="100" t="g" i="chopped walnuts" />
  <Ingredient v="1" t="tsp" i="baking soda (Natron)" />
  <Ingredient v="1" t="tsp" i="baking powder" />
</ul>

For a sourdough version, replace baking powder with <Ingredient notList v="100" t="g" i="sourdough starter"/>.

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 150ºC. Line a 20cm loaf tin.
2. Melt **butter** in a large pan. Whisk in **brown sugar** until smooth, then stir in **mashed banana**.
3. Whisk in **eggs** and **vanilla**. Add **salt**, **cinnamon**, **nutmeg**, **baking soda** (**Natron**), and **baking powder** (or **sourdough starter**). Whisk until the ingredients are fully dispersed in the batter. Watch out for small pockets of dry ingredients in the mix.
4. Add **flour** and stir until combined. Scrape batter into prepared loaf tin.
5. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the **raw sugar**; it will seem like a lot but will bake up beautifully.
6. Bake banana bread for 65 to 75 minutes, or more. Test with a skewer—the top third is often slowest to cook. The bread will get very dark but will not taste burnt.
7. Let cool in pan. This banana bread is good on the first day but exceptional on the second and third.
