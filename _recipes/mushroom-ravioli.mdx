## Instructions

1. First, start with the dough. Add the **flour**, **egg** and **salt** to a bowl. Mix everything by hand—it will be crumbly at first but should smoothen after 10–15 minutes of kneading. Keep the dough aside under a bowl for 20 minutes.
2. Second, prepare the ravioli filling. Add some **olive oil** to a pan. When it is hot enough, add the **diced shallot** and cook for a few minutes until transparent. Add the **diced mushrooms**, cook until tender before finally adding the **minced garlic** for one more minute.
3. Add some **grated nutmeg**, **lemon zest**, **parmesan cheese**, **salt**, **pepper** and a dash of **cream** to bind everything together. Keep aside until cool.
4. Go back to your dough. Roll it out into a long rectangle, it should be extremely thin (about 1 mm or less).
5. Cut out the dough into rectangle stripes of approximately 5 x 10 cm—they should be twice the size of your final ravioli.
6. Add a bit of mushroom filling on all the stripes, keeping one half free. Also make sure to keep about 1 cm of free dough all around the filling.
7. With a wet finger, lightly moisten the “edges of the dough”. Fold the ravioli onto itself and strongly press the edges together—they should be the same thickness as the “single dough layer”. Finally press a fork end around the three recently closed edges.
8. Cook the ravioli for 3–5 minutes in salted boiling water. Dry them when done.
9. Let’s start the mushroom sauce. Add some **olive oil** to a pan. When it is hot enough, add the **diced shallot** and cook for a few minutes until they change color. Add the **sliced mushrooms**, cook until tender before finally adding the **minced garlic** for one more minute.
10. Add the **vegetable stock** and cook until reduced by half. Add the **cream**, **salt** and **pepper** and cook for one more minute.
11. Serve the ravioli on a plate with some sauce, grated cheese and herbs.
