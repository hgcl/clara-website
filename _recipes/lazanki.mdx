## Ingredients

Vegetables:

- 1 large onion
- ½ head of medium cabbage
- 2 cups of water
- 1 tbs of salt

Dumplings:

- 3 cups / 400 g of all purpose flour
- 1 egg
- Pinch of salt
- 300 ml of warm water (that was too much, maybe 200ml instead?)

Additionally:

- 4 tbs of butter
- 3 tbs of all purpose flour
- 3-4 tbs of fresh dill

## Instructions

1. Dice onions. Heat medium pan, sauté until both golden brown. Add mushrooms and sauté a few more minutes.
2. In the mean time, chop cabbage into relatively small pieces. I cut it into thin slices first, then into smaller bits. Heat a large pot, add cabbage, water and salt and boil for 5-7 minutes, until cabbage is soft, but still a bit crunchy.
3. When onions and mushrooms are ready, add to pot with cabbage. Mix until combined, turn heat off.
4. Set a large pot of water on for boiling dumplings now. We want the water to be ready right when the dumplings are made.
5. To make dumplings, place flour, egg and salt in the mixing bowl. Mix and start adding water until a ball forms, if it gets too wet, add a bit more flour. When all ingredients combine, transfer dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut into strips (a pizza cutter works great!) and then diagonally.
6. Sprinkle dumplings with flour and, with a help of your knife lift them off of your surface, so they do not stick together.
7. When water is boiling, slide them off your cutting board into the pot and IMMEDIATELY stir gently, we don't want them clumping together. Turn heat down and let simmer until dumplings float to the top. Drain and set aside. Dump boiling water, add a couple of tablespoons of butter to the same pot and add dumplings (this is a secret trick from my grandma, makes the dumplings even better)! Sauté for a few minutes, stir gently often, until they get a little color.
8. Heat a small pan, add butter. Once melted, add flour. Mix until it becomes a smooth and bubbly sauce, about 2 min. Return cabbage to heat. Add flour/butter mixture to cabbage and mix well. Also add dumplings and mix. You might have to add a bit of water at this point. Cabbage should be moist but not saucy. You can easily add about a cup of water.
9. Taste, add a bit more salt and pepper, if needed. Sprinkle with chopped dill. Serve hot.
