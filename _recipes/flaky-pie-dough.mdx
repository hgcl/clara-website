## Ingredients

<ul>
  <Ingredient optional v="1" i="egg" />
  <Ingredient v="2.5" t="tbsp" i="ice water" />

  <Ingredient v="0.5" t="tsp" i="salt" />

It is also possible to replace the butter by the same amount of solid coconut oil.

## Instructions

Tip 1: Adding an egg to the quiche crust recipe will help bind the ingredients together and keep your crust from collapsing when removed from the quiche pan.

Tip 2: It's important that the quiche crust is cold when filled and baked. Here's the test: the cold dough should not lose its shape when pressed. When the fat (the butter) within the dough gets cold it helps keep the thin layers of flour/water separated which is exactly what's needed to achieve a beautiful flaky quiche crust!

1. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the **egg** and **ice water**. Set the bowl aside
2. Mix the **flour** and **salt** in a bowl. Add in the cubed **butter** pieces and mix until the mixture resembles wet sand. Add in the egg/ice-water mixture one tablespoon at a time until a lovely dough forms.
3. Transfer the dough onto a lightly-floured board. Roll out the crust so that it fits the measurements of your pan or dish. Lay the rolled out dough onto the top of the pan. Using your hands, gently press the dough into place. With a paring knife, slice off any extra dough that's hanging over the rim of the pan or dish.
4. Stick the pan with the dough into the freezer for approximately 20-25 minutes (but if you leave it in there a bit longer, that's fine too). For a flaky crust it's important that the crust is cold when it's filled and cooked.
5. Your cold crust is ready to be filled and baked!
