## Instructions

Tip: I put the butter in the oven at 30°C for 10 minutes to get it soft enough to work with.

1. Preheat oven to 180°C and grease a loaf pan.
2. In a bowl, cream **butter** and **sugar** for 5 minutes, until it's nice and fluffy. Add in the **eggs** one at a time, mixing until each is fully combined. Add the **sourdough starter** and **orange zest**.
3. Add the dry ingredients: **flour**, **baking powder**, and **salt**. Mix until fully combined.
4. Add the **orange juice** and **sour cream**, mix until fully combined.
5. Bake for 45–55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes.
