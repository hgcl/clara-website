## Instructions

Tips:

- You can also consider substituting broth (beef broth, chicken broth, seafood broth, or vegetable broth) for the water in this recipe, which will give the eggs a different, robust flavor. This flavorful version is a nice choice when serving a steamed egg as part of lunch or dinner.
- For an extra bit of flavor, swap some of the salt for soy sauce.
- For a nontraditional addition, top the cooked steamed egg with a sprinkling of cheese.

1. In a heat-safe bowl—porcelain or stoneware work best—whisk together the **eggs**, **water**, **scallions**, and **salt** until fully combined.
2. If using a microwave, cover the bowl with a plate and cook for 4 minutes.
3. If steaming on a stovetop, add the bowl to a steamer and steam for 10 minutes over medium-high heat.
4. Serve and enjoy.
