Robin and I discovered this dish when cycling with our tandem bike in the Chianti region in 2019. Since then, the _ribollita_ is a recurring dish in our kitchen. We make with any leftover veggies and bread we have.

## Ingredients

- ½ lb. dried cannellini beans (1 ⅓ cups)
- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ onion
- 1 carrot
- 1 celery stalk
- 1 garlic clove
- 2-3 thyme sprigs (leaves only)
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 potato, medium sized
- ½ lb. lacinato kale (roughly a bunch)
- ½ head Savoy cabbage (about ¾ lb.)
- ⅓ lb. Swiss chard
- 1 Tbsp. tomato paste or ⅓ cup of canned diced tomatoes or 1 fresh tomato
- ½ lb. whole wheat, rustic, stale bread (brown paesano or pain de champagne or country brown, but a rustic white such as sourdough would also work)
- To taste, freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Place the (unsoaked!) dried **beans** in the smaller pot with 4 cups of cold water and just ½ teaspoon of salt. Turn on the heat to medium and bring to a gentle boil, then turn down the heat to the lowest setting and cover with a lid. Keep simmering until cooked (between 3- and 3 ½ hours in my experience). Otherwise use soaked beans and cook them in the same amount of water, until done (cooking time will be quicker).
2. Meanwhile, chop the **carrot**, **onion**, and **celery**. Mince the **garlic**. Peel and dice the **potatoes**, clean and cut the remaining **vegetables** into ½-inch slices or cubes. Set aside.
3. When the beans are cooked, drain them, reserving the cooking water. In a blender or food processor, puree about ¾ of the beans and return the bean purée to the cooking water. Set aside. Also set aside the remaining whole beans.
4. In a large pot, prepare the soffritto: heat 1/3 cup extra-virgin **olive oil**, and sauté the **carrot**, **celery**, **garlic** and **onion** over medium-high heat, until golden in color, about 7-8 minutes. Stir often to avoid burning.
5. Add the **thyme leaves**, the remaining 1/2 tsp. of **salt**, the remaining fresh **vegetables**, the **tomato paste**, the bean purée with its water, along with an additional 4 cups of **water**. Cook over low heat, covered, for about 1 hour.
6. Finally, add the previously cooked whole beans and the **stale bread**, cut into ½-inch slices, crust on. Stir, cook for another 5 minutes and turn off the heat.
7. Let soup sit for at least a few hours, ideally overnight. Then, reheat the soup, boiling for a few minutes at low heat.
8. Serve sprinkled with freshly ground **black pepper** and drizzled with a little high-quality extra-virgin **olive oil**.
