## Instructions

1. First combine 150g of **all-purpose flour** with 1g of **kosher salt**. Whisk together until completely combined and add 80ml of **water**.
2. Whisk together and then knead until a shaggy, sticky dough has formed and let rest on a well floured surface for 20 minutes underneath a bowl
3. Once the dough has rested for 20 minutes, on a well -floured surface roll the dough out into a 30 x 30 cm square. Spread ⅓ of the unsalted, **soft butter** over ⅔ of the dough then fold into thirds. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and then roll out into a square and repeating the process one last time before adding the rest of the soft butter to 90% of the surface and leaving 2 cm uncovered.
4. Moisten the 1-inch un-buttered area with wet fingers and tightly roll the dough into a log from the opposite end. Roll and press lightly to seal shut and wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
5. To make the custard, add 100 g of **granulated sugar**, 50 ml of **water**, 1 **cinnamon** stick, and ½ a **peel of a lemon** (make sure to wash thoroughly to remove any wax). Bring this mixture to a simmer so that the sugar is dissolved. Once dissolved, take it off the heat and let cool for 30 minutes.
6. Into a large bowl combine 40 g of **all-purpose flour**, a third of the 1 ½ cup of **whole milk** then whisk together thoroughly until thick and no lumps remain.
7. Pour the rest of the **whole milk** into a large saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until just simmering, at which point add the flour and milk mixture. Whisk constantly and cook 1-3 minutes until thick, gooey, and/or creamy.
8. Once mixed into a creamy pancake-like batter, kill the heat and add the sugar syrup along with ½ tsp of **vanilla powder** (or ½ tsp of vanilla extract). Whisk thoroughly to combine until slightly cooled off. Then add 6 large **egg yolks** and whisk together into a smooth custard. The hotter your mixture is, the faster you will have to whisk together in order not to scramble the eggs.
9. For the sake of smoothness, strain through a fine mesh sieve to catch any errant lumps.
10. Retrieve the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, trim off the uneven edges of the dough roll and divide into 12 equally sized pieces. When looked at from the side, the rolls should have a tight buttered swirl.
11. Place the dough into the center of the cupcake tin and gently press it down from the center out - first trying to cover the bottom of the tin, followed by the sides. Rinse and repeat until the cupcake tin is full.
12. Fill each pastry ¾ of the way full with the custard mixture then place on a preheated baking sheet that has been sitting in a 250°C oven for about 20 minutes. Place the tin and baking sheet combo into a 250°C oven for 12-16 minutes, until the custard is puffed and the pastry is golden brown. Serve and enjoy!

Notes: My microwave-oven only goes up to 230°C. I baked them for 20 minutes—will try to leave them longer next time.
